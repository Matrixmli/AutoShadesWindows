# Project Name
Automated Windows and Window Shades

My project uses machine learning to determine whether it is day or night outside. It also asks you if you want your shades or windows to be opened and closed. With this information, it will automatically make the correct choices based on your needs.

## The Algorithm
My algorithm detects if it is night or day. I gave it many different images to train. The AI would find patterns and learn if a picture was taken at night or during the day. If the AI determines that it is night time, it will close windows and pull down shades. If the AI determines that it is day time, it will open the windows and pull down shades. Below, there are a few images that show how confindent my program is with machine learning.
